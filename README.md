This is a tile matching game written in React. It was designed by Dave Gilman of [Cognito Creative](http://www.cognitocreative.com/) in 2009 and originally implemented in Flash. Seeing the rapid demise of Flash, Dave asked me to port it over to HTML5.

You can see the React version here: http://client.benbrooks.net/cognitration/
