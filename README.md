This is a tile matching game written in React. It was designed by Dave Gilman of [Cognito Creative](http://www.cognitocreative.net/) in 2009 and implemented in Flash. Seeing the rapid demise of Flash, Dave asked me to port it over to HTML5.

You can see it in the wild at http://client.benbrooks.net/cognitration/
