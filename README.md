This is a tile matching game written in React. It was designed by Dave Gilman of [Cognito Creative](http://www.cognitocreative.net/) in 2009 and implemented in Flash by another developer. Seeing the rapid demise of Flash, he asked me to port it over to HTML5.

You can see it in the wild at http://www.cognitocreative.net/cognitration
